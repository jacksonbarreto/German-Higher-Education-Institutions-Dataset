# German Higher Education Institutions Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of higher education institutions in Germany.  This includes 422 higher education institutions in Germany, including 108 universities, 210 universities of applied sciences, 52 colleges of art and music, 30 colleges of public administration, 16 theological universities, and 6 colleges of education.
This dataset was compiled in response to a cybersecurity investigation of German higher education institutions' websites [1]. The data is being made publicly available to promote open science principles [2].

## Data

The data includes the following fields for each institution:

- Number: A unique identifier assigned to each institution.
- Name: The full name of the institution.
- Category: Indicates whether the institution is public or private.
- Region: The federal state in which the institution is located.
- Url: The website of the institution.

## Methodology

The original list was obtained from the Higher Education Compass website [3], a portal of the German Rectors' Conference (Hochschulrektorenkonferenz – HRK), which publishes information about German universities recognized by the state and their opportunities for study and doctoral degrees and international partnerships. All information contained in the Higher Education Compass is authorized by the universities and updated by university staff. 
The obtained information was processed and organized, and the fields not necessary for the original research were excluded. The final data was compiled into the dataset included in this repository.
